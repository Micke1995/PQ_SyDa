# PQ event toolbox


### This toolbox provides a versatile collection of tools designed specifically to create robust and varied datasets used in the evaluation and testing of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. 
### Is a usefull tool for researchers, data scientists, and developers who need synthetic or custom datasets that reflect different scenarios and distributions for analysis and model development.



**Key Features:**

+ **Synthetic Data Generation:** Enables the creation of artificial data based on predefined PQ events. This facilitates the creation of customized datasets with specific characteristics.
  
+ **Dimensionality and Complexity Control:** Provides options to adjust data dimensionality, complexity of relationships between variables, and the presence of noise or outliers, enabling comprehensive testing of algorithms.
  
+ **Automatic Labeling**: Offers capabilities for automatically labeling generated datasets according to predefined rules  streamlining the data preparation process for model training and validation.
  
+ **Integration with ML Frameworks:** Compatible with major machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, among others, facilitating seamless integration of generated datasets into development and experimentation pipelines.
  
+ **Visualization and Exploratory Analysis:** Includes tools for visualizing and performing exploratory analysis of generated datasets, allowing for a deep understanding of data characteristics and distributions before their use in machine learning models.
