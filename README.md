# PQ event toolbox


### This toolbox provides a versatile collection of tools designed specifically to create robust and varied datasets used in the evaluation and testing of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. 
### Is a usefull tool for researchers, data scientists, and developers who need synthetic or custom datasets that reflect different scenarios and distributions for analysis and model development.



**Key Features:**

+ **Synthetic Data Generation:** Enables the creation of artificial data based on predefined PQ events. This facilitates the creation of customized datasets with specific characteristics.
  
+ **Dimensionality and Complexity Control:** Provides options to adjust data dimensionality, complexity of relationships between variables, and the presence of noise or outliers, enabling comprehensive testing of algorithms.
  
+ **Automatic Labeling**: Offers capabilities for automatically labeling generated datasets according to predefined rules  streamlining the data preparation process for model training and validation.
  
+ **Integration with ML Frameworks:** Compatible with major machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, among others, facilitating seamless integration of generated datasets into development and experimentation pipelines.
  
+ **Visualization and Exploratory Analysis:** Includes tools for visualizing and performing exploratory analysis of generated datasets, allowing for a deep understanding of data characteristics and distributions before their use in machine learning models.

 This toolbox let you generate and visualize up to 28 power quality events and let you modify caracteristics realted to each one of them.

# Note:
+ All the machine models pass by the funcion  
In this repository there are 2 models that you can load and use.

+ The firs model is a Desicion tree
That's all.
